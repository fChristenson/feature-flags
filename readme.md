# Feature flags

## What we will cover

- What is a feature flag?
- Why are they useful?
- When do we want to use them?

## Notes

Feature flags is a way to state what features are available in your system.
They allow us to ship code and then turn on and off a feature.

More advanced feature flags can show different features to different users.
These flags can as an example be set based on:

- Who the user is
- Where the user is
